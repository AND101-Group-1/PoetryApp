**Top 3**: Star finder, poetry app, and aquarium tracker


## Step 2b: Evaluate ideas
### App#1: Star Finder
**Mobile**: People who want to look up stars from any place they are will need an app to quickly search stars from their location.

**Story**:  It would provide educational value to any user interested in stars. Our peers would be interested in this because it provides a fun and interesting experience to learn about stars in your current location or somewhere else.

**Market**: It has potential for a large base of casual users interested in astronomy. This can also be an educational resource on schools for students and teachers. 

**Habit**: This app would be used casually when people are outdoors interested in the stars or during school lessons about stars.

**Scope**: Right now we are seeing the APIs for this mobile app would be technically challenging to use during the timeframe. It would still be worth doing a stripped down version of the app because we could still continue building on it later. 

### App#2: Aquarium Tracker
**Mobile**: This app will provide an interactive and quick way for people to find fish species on the go.

**Story**: The audience for this app is for kids on aquarium visits where they want to find facts about the fish they see. These visits could be either with parents on the weekend or during school field trips.

**Market**: Any kid can use this app with their parents and at schools too.

**Habit**: This app would be used casually when the users want to find specific fish species. A specific scenario of usage is at aquariums, but it can be used in other places like school lessons or whenever a person wants to research

**Scope**: We still have to research how challenging to use the API for this app is. If we have to strip down this app, it would still be an interesting app to build because the topic itself and the specific scenario at aquariums is interesting.

### App#3: Daily Poetry App
**Mobile**: The poetry app will provide the user with daily and quick access to new poems. Users will have the opportunity to discover new works and save them right on their phones.

**Story**: The app has the opportunity to attract more people into poetry. Knowing where to start reading poetry can be a daunting, so this app can help people get into poetry. 

**Market**: The main users for this app are people who like reading poetry, and people just starting with it. In 2022, around 22 million adults in the US read poetry which makes it a large market. This number does not even include casual and new readers.

**Habit**: The average user would open this app daily because of our feature to display a daily poem. Moreover, active users will use this app multiple times a day to discover and save new poems.

**Scope**: The app may be technically challenging to build all the features we have defined; however, our group finds this app interesting even if we have to strip it down. For the first version we would prioritize the daily poem feature. Then, we would include filters based on authors, type, title, etc. Lastly, we want to create collections of poems based on a topic like seasonal or genre.
